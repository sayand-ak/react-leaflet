Leaflet Map Location Fetcher
This project demonstrates how to use the Leaflet library to fetch the user's location when they click on the map. The project also uses the Nominatim API from OpenStreetMap to get details about the location, such as the address and place information based on the latitude and longitude.

Features
Interactive Map: Uses Leaflet to display a map and allow users to click on any location.
Location Fetching: When the user clicks on the map, the latitude and longitude of the clicked point are captured.
Reverse Geocoding: The project uses Nominatim's reverse geocoding API to get details (such as the address) about the clicked location.
Technologies Used
React - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
Leaflet - A popular JavaScript library for interactive maps.
Nominatim API - An open-source geocoding API to fetch location details.
Redux - Used for state management in the project (for storing fetched location information).
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaflet-location-fetcher.git
cd leaflet-location-fetcher
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser: The project will automatically open at http://localhost:3000.

How it Works
Map Interaction: The map is displayed using Leaflet. When the user clicks on a location, the click event captures the latitude and longitude of the clicked point.

Fetching Location Data: The following API call is made when the user clicks on the map:

javascript
Copy code
const url = `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=jsonv2&lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}`;
This API fetches reverse geocoding data, such as the address and place name, based on the clicked latitude and longitude.

Displaying Data: The fetched data (such as the address) is stored in Redux and can be displayed to the user using a Popup component in Leaflet.
